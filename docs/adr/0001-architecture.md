# ADR 0001 — Overall architecture

Status: **accepted** · Date: 2026-08-10

## Context

Self-hosted platform where a host opens a **room**, picks a console and a game,
and up to four players join **from their browser**, each with their own
controller. Emulation runs server-side on an AMD GPU.

Prior art was surveyed: **no open-source project combines libretro + hardware
GPU cores + zero-copy VAAPI on AMD.** `EmuStream` is closest but is NVENC/x264
only; `CloudRetro` has rooms but encodes in software and targets light retro.

## Decisions

### D1 — We do NOT write an emulator

Dolphin is ~500 k lines and 23 years of work (~65-70 person-years). A from-scratch
GameCube core is 3-8 person-years for a worse result — **and would fix none of the
problems actually observed**, which were all plumbing: SDL renaming devices,
unstable `js*` indices, browsers dropping non-standard gamepads, uinput.

### D2 — Rust for the worker, Python/TypeScript above it

Rust ONLY where latency and the GPU live. The control plane is not on the hot
path — an input never traverses it — so its language is chosen for velocity.
Every critical-path building block already exists in Rust (`wl-screenrec` is the
only published dma-buf→VAAPI zero-copy implementation, plus `webrtcsink`,
Smithay, `inputtino`).

### D3 — Controllers are normalised in the BROWSER

Each client converts its own pad (DualSense, Xbox, GameCube adapter, keyboard)
into one canonical GameCube state and sends 13 bytes. The worker writes it to a
Dolphin **named pipe**. No SDL, no uinput, no device index anywhere in between.

### D4 — Slot assignment is server state

The room decides that a member is player 2. It is never inferred from an
enumeration order.

### D5 — Sunshine's encode topology, not capture-then-import

Allocate the VAAPI surface first, export it, let a shader write NV12 into it.
Mesa rejects DCC modifiers for the video engine on everything before RDNA4 (the
target GPU is RDNA2), so a naive render→export→import pipeline fails or corrupts.

### D6 — Hey API for the generated TypeScript client (M4)

`utoipa` emits the OpenAPI document; **Hey API** (`@hey-api/openapi-ts`) generates
the typed client and TanStack Query hooks. Chosen over Kubb: more actively
maintained, first-class Query plugin. The committed snapshot is gated by a
deterministic contract check so the client cannot silently drift.

## Consequences

- AV1 encoding is unavailable (needs RDNA3+). Target H.264/HEVC.
- Dolphin headless must be built from source: no distro package ships
  `dolphin-emu-nogui`, and the AppImage does not contain it.
- Netplay is explicitly NOT used: one emulator instance, four ports, one video
  stream. Split-screen is not a compromise — every 4-player GameCube game is
  split-screen by design.

"""The lobby, against a real server and a real client.

Not a unit test with a fake session: what is worth checking here is the seam
itself. The handlers reach into the ASGI scope to find the room, which depends on
how the socket app is mounted — the sort of coupling that keeps working in a
unit test and fails the moment it is served.
